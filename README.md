## Introduction
ezMiro is an online whiteboard software created with Miro in mind. It allows multiple people to work on the whiteboard at the same time and synchronize data in real time.

We use Event Storming and DDD for requirement analysis and software design, and Clean Architecture for system architecture, and finally TDD for implementation.
